Idea: have Emma and Grace produce some illustrations for this


# Finding Change in the CouchDB

# Big Data

# We've got the biggest Data of them all

# New tools:  non-relational databases

(aka "NoSQL")

# Old tool:  PostgreSQL

# The question:

"Is the current reading of volume and occupancy from some detector
more or less than what should be expected?"

# Old way

Precompute some average value by time of day, and compare.

# But we had the data in  PostgreSQL, so...

# Big Query

"What is the average volume and occupancy for every 5 minute period
over the prior 365 days (less holidays) for the past year, for any
loop detector"

# Slow

The index was too big to fit in RAM, leading to heavy swapping

# That broke my database

# Big Data, NoSQL

* Google (Big Table)
* Amazon (Dynamo)

# Options considered

* flat files
* CouchDB
* TokyoTyrant
* Cassandra
* Hadoop

# Options available now

* Hadoop
* Riak
* MongoDB
* CouchDB
* Cassandra
* RethinkDB
* Voldemort
* Datalog

# Why do I think CouchDB is good for transportation data?

# Transportation data

* largely observations and measurements
* write once
* read raw data for short term applications
* process raw data into spatio-temporal summary stats

# Example: Loop Detectors

* 30s volume, occupancy
* some misses and noise
* might need known, fixed cleanup procedures to be applied

# Example: Personal GPS and activity stream

* second by second GPS
* slowly growing sets of:
    * routes,
    * destinations,
    * time windows
* small set of repeated queries:
    * Optimize likely activities?
    * Does traffic affect my usual pattern?
    * etc

# Why do I think CouchDB is good for transportation data?

# What is CouchDB?

# What is a database?

* store data
* get data
* allow multiple users


# Compare with flat files

* One file per loop detector per year
* Append to file as data arrives
* Easy to organize and distribute

# Flat files are:

* Good for data cleaning, stats generation, imputation of missing
  data, etc
* Fine for single user
    * Consistent
    * Available
* Not *performant*

# Is performant a word?


# Flat files can lead to trouble

* Not fine for multiuser
    * race conditions,
    * version problems,
    * etc
* Difficult to query

> "What was the volume and occupancy like last Monday?"


# Use a database

# But there is the CAP theorem

* Consistency
* Availability
* Performance

> _**Choose any two**_


# CouchDB

* Chooses **A**vailability, **P**erformance
* Document model, not schema based

> "Eventually Consistent"

# Consistency isn't that big a deal for traffic data

* Events are observed by one or more sensors
* Sensors write their observations


# Events vs Observations

* The *observations* don't change
* The interpretation of the *event* might change
* But a consistent interpretation isn't mission critical

# Bonus: CouchDB has master-master replication

# Replication is super awesome and a massive *change*

# New data collection architecture

* One DB at each detector
* Central database replicates all detector databases
* Global queries can go to central DB
* Local queries can go directly to detector DBs
* A traveler can replicate only the traffic DBs along common routes


# All replicating databases will be eventually consistent

# Relax

# Practical experience

## what we are doing with CouchDB

# Processing Raw Loop Detector Data

Orange County, California (CalTrans District 12)

* about 900 mainline detectors
* Process in R
    * compute 27 different measures per location
    * for 20 minute running time window
    * (vol, occ per lane + 27 ) per 30s period
    * run models estimating relative risk of accident types

# Database design:

* One CouchDB database per detector
* One document per day

# Document per day reasons:

* Based on ~~painful experience~~ informal testing
* One document per year is too big to process
* One document per timestamp would work okay,
* But the web *application* uses daily data
* CouchDB sorts by document id, id is based on timestamp
* HTTP GET:

    /vdsdata/d12/2007/1202248/ 1202248\ 2007-01-03\ 00:00:00

# Database per detector per year reasons:

* One big database is possible, but
* Prior to BigCouch, impossible to *split* or *shard* over different
  machines
* makes better use of multi-core machines when generating views


# Use views to run models and summarize data

* Views are CouchDB's version of map/reduce
* Write JavaScript code for the map function that is run on each
  document (to apply models, run summaries, etc)
* ProTip^Â©^ Only use embedded Erlang reduce functions like
  `_count`,`_sum`, and `_stats`


# Difficulty: Need to use another database to collate model output

* Pipe summaries of the per-detector views to a single database for
  all detectors in the district
* Requires external programming
* Difficult to automate


# Application 2: Storing the results of imputation runs

* Similar to prior example
* Databases spread over three machines
* Uses per-district collation databases
* Analysis step used CouchDB to coordinate multiple processes
    * Local "state" database on each machine
    * State databases replicated with each other
    * No overlapping runs were observed

# Application 3: Convenient stash for detector information

* Uses GeoCouch extensions, stores location of each detector
* stashes all known information about each detector in a single place
* uses binary attachments to save R analysis output (plots, files)
