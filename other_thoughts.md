work more at dumping techniques papers.

lots of interest in data things

Data privacy is important.  Important enough that Georgia Tech isn't
going to release data because they can attack it and discover data.

What about sampling the links, not sampling the complete paths?

Guy did an interesting poster on travel patterns among gay and lesbian
couples compared to hetero couples, living in like communities.  Some
pre-conceived hypotheses were rejected.  At UCLA and Rutgers.

In vermont, commercial density is correlated positively with body mass
index, while proximity to "downtown" is negatively correlated, unless
income is controlled, in which case downtown is not significant.

Rural vermont == active lifestyle.

So active transportation is rural, or walking environment urban.

A guy at Portland State did work on commute satisfaction and mode.
Bicycles and walkers are happiest with their commutes.  Cars least
so.  Guy did not control for self selection bias, that is, whether
people who were most happy about everything were more likely to choose
bike commute.

Longer commute times by bike were assoc. with happiest with commute,
while for cars time is negatively correlated.

Transportation as an industry has a good representation of women, but
it isn't 50/50.
